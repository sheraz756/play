                <p><b>Q-</b> How can i cancel my membership? </p>

                <p><b>A-</b> After using account for 1 month Playeon will ask you to pay for the next month and you cant access content meanwhile. So basically it's on cancelled stage after paying for the next month you can access content and use your account for the next month. This proccess will take place after every month. Because we dont charge auto subscription fee, user will pay manually after every month accordingly. </p>
